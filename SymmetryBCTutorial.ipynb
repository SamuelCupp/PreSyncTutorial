    "In the first tutorial, we successfully updated a thorn to use PreSync. This demonstrated two different update types:\n",
    "1. updating a thorn that doesn't include boundary routines\n",
    "    1. add READ/WRITE declarations to scheduled functions\n",
    "    2. place all old boundary scheduling into a legacy if statement\n",
    "    3. add scheduling of BC selection routines in the PreSync_Selection group\n",
    "    4. change DECLARE_CCTK_ARGUMENTS to the new macro and include the cctk_Arguments_Checked.h header file\n",
    "2. Updating a boundary condition registered and applied using the Boundary thorn\n",
    "    1. apply the changes for a standard thorn\n",
    "    2. include the PreSync.h header file in the files with the boundary condition and registration functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The second case has an important qualifier: it was specifically for boundary conditions which use Boundary to apply their boundary conditions. How do we change a boundary routine which doesn't use Boundary? In addition to this, there exists another less obvious case to consider. Symmetry boundary conditions (scheduled in BoundaryConditions group in Boundary) need to be applied to all variables, unlike physical boundary conditions. This means that PreSync needs to use a different system to apply them than the physical boundary conditions.\n",

    "in this tutorial, we examine the symmetry boundary condition registered by the thorn ReflectionSymmetry thorn and how this thorn is changed to use PreSync. To start, we need to access ReflectionSymmetry without the PreSync changes. To do this, we will copy the master branch into the Tutorial directory so we may compare more easily inside this notebook."

Originally, symmetry boundary conditions were applied by the Boundary thorn. Symmetry functions were registered with Symbase, and then the ApplyBC function was scheduled inside the BoundaryConditions group provided by the Boundary thorn. This scheduled function should only run if PreSync is not active, so it checks the value of use_psync. In addition, the name changes from ReflectionSymmetry_ApplyBC to Old_ReflectionSymmetry_ApplyBC. This is because the argument lists are different for the two functions, so they must be declared separately. We will see the details of this change later."

This is a new function provided by Boundary2 to register symmetry boundary conditions with PreSync. The implementation is very similar to the Boundary_RegisterPhysicalBC provided by Boundary and Boundary2. Any thorn which provides symmetry boundary conditions must use this function to properly interface with PreSync. Also, most symmetry functions use Boundary_SelectedGVs. To properly implement the new function later, we must change the REQUIRES to USES. This is because it is only provided by Boundary, not Boundary2, and REQUIRES will demand that it is provided even though it is not used."

The first difference is just a new name for the function, which we saw earlier in the schedule.ccl. the second change swaps out the macros. The last change adds several new lines of code.
