    "    1. add READ/WRITE declarations to scheduled functions\n",
    "    2. place all old boundary scheduling into a legacy if statement\n",

How do we change a boundary routine which doesn't use Boundary? In addition to this, there exists another less obvious case to consider. Symmetry boundary conditions (scheduled in BoundaryConditions group in Boundary) need to be applied to all variables, unlike physical boundary conditions. This means that PreSync needs to use a different system to apply them than the physical boundary conditions.\n",

Several READ/WRITE declarations follow, as we would expect. The last change is different. Originally, symmetry boundary conditions were applied by the Boundary thorn. Symmetry functions were registered with Symbase, and then the ApplyBC function was scheduled inside te BoundaryConditions group provided by the Boundary thorn. This scheduled function should only run if PreSync is not active, so it checks the value of use_psync. In addition, the name changes from CartGrid3D_ApplyBC to Old_CartGrid3D_ApplyBC.

However, this declares *every* variable and not just those needed by the function. To reduce these declarations and provide additional error-checking, PreSync provides new (optional) macros which are generated based on the read/write declarations. Each scheduled function has its own macro which only provides access to declared variables. In addition, read-only declarations are declared as const, which provides additional verification for read/write declarations. To include these new macros, we add\n",
