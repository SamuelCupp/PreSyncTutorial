# PreSyncTutorial
Tutorial for the PreSync Update to the Cactus Framework

This repository contains two tutorials in the form of
jupyter notebooks. IntroTutorial provides an introduction
to using PreSync. In it, the thorn OldWave is changed
to use PreSync, and backward compatibility is shown.

SymmetryBCTutorial shows how to change a thorn which
provides a symmetry BC to use PreSync. While this tutorial
is not directly useful for most thorns, it provides some
more specific information on how boundary routines are registered
with PreSync.


In addition to the tutorials, the thornlist presync.th is
included. This thornlist contains the thorns which have
been updated to work with PreSync.
